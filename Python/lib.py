# DESCRIPTION

# the function delay_cmd() inserts a random delay from 10 to 20 seconds
# It has no input or output parameters
# It requires the functions randint from random Python package and sleep from time Python package

# send_ser_cmd() INTERFACE

# It receives a string as an input parameter, that is the command to send to a serial port.
# It returns a global variable, t_score, that is a string containing a time interval value and its
# measure unit (ms) or an error string.
# First of all, the function send_ser_cmd() opens a serial port and sets the communication parameters.
# If command_to_send is equal to "L 1" ("L 0"), but the global variable LED_state is equal to 1 (0),
# the user wants to turn on (turn off) the LED, but the LED is already turned on (turned off): the function
# updates t_score and return an error string equal to E0001 (E0000) is returned. If command_to_send is equal to "L 1"
# and LED_state is equal to 0, the function sends to the serial port "L 1" and updates LED_state to 1. If
# command_to_send is equal to "L 0" and LED_state is equal to 1, the function updates LED_state to 0,
# sends to the serial port "L 0" and then waits until 5 bytes from the port are
# received. The 5 bytes contains a time interval value and the function returns the string containing the
# time interval value and its measure unit.
# To convert into a string the byte object received by the serial port, the function makes use of
# t_score_byte_object_conversion_to_seconds, a function defined in the same module of the first.
